# VOICE-ASSISTANT

This project focuses on building an intelligent voice assistant using Python. The voice assistant is capable of responding to user commands, retrieving information from the web, managing tasks, and interacting with various applications using speech recognition and synthesis.
Key Features:
Speech Recognition: The assistant uses the SpeechRecognition library to convert user voice inputs into text, making the interaction seamless and hands-free.
Speech Synthesis: With the help of pyttsx3, the assistant responds with human-like voice output, providing an engaging user experience.
APIs Integration:
  Weather API: Fetches real-time weather data based on user queries.
  News API: Provides the latest news headlines from trusted sources.
  Task Management: Uses the Google Calendar API to manage and schedule tasks based on voice commands.
Web Automation: The assistant leverages the selenium library to automate web browsing tasks such as searching, form filling, and data extraction.
Technologies Used:
Python Libraries: SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, nltk, selenium
APIs: OpenWeatherMap API, NewsAPI, Google Calendar API
Additional Tools: pyaudio for handling audio streams
